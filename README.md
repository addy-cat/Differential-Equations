The goal is to make something like this: https://homepages.bluffton.edu/~nesterd/apps/slopefields.html (select "System" from options), where a user can enter two differential equations, have the cooresponding vector field appear, and then have the ability to click anywhere for solution curves to appear. 

Uses Exprtk for mathematical parsing, and ImGui for user interface, and OpenGL (using C++) for graphics.
