My latest personal project! This program uses C++ with OpenGL for graphics modelling. This is my first time using OpenGL.

The ultimate goal is to make something like this: https://homepages.bluffton.edu/~nesterd/apps/slopefields.html (select "System" from options), where a user can enter two differential equations, have the cooresponding vector field appear, and then have the ability to click anywhere for solution curves to appear.
